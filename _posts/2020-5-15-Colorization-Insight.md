# Introduction

## What is Colorization

Colorization is to turning grayscale(mostly) images or videos to colorized version, without losing its original content.

## Why Colorization

Most images and videos in old age is in grayscale or monocolor. The aim of colorization is to get vivid and realistic visual effect, bring people back to their old age, and arise their memory. In video, such as movies and documentaries, colorized version can improve the watching experience. We take some small experiences and find out that human eyes are more appeal to colorized version of images and videos. Thus, colorized version is always better than grayscale version in visual experience. Moreover, colorized version contains more information.
