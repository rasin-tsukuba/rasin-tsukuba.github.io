# Setting the Stage for Clustering

Clustering can be thought of in two main ways: subdivide the data or not.

Subdividing the data means to partition the data into smaller clusters. 

Opposite of partitioning or subdividing the data is to cluster data in a pairwise fashion: recursively from the "top-down" or from the "bottom-up".

Prior to fitting clustering algorithms, we must first set the stage. This typically consists of **assessing clusterability** and then **defining distance** (similarity and dissimilarity between observations).

## Assessing Clusterability
